# Autolog

Hey there fellow racers, welcome to the Autolog. This is a simple, yet most accurate way of logging your progress in the world of public road racing. Focusing on small road sections and not on the whole track, Autolog is a great tool for those who want to see their progress in a more detailed way in a short period of time. Autolog focuses on distance driven by the driver in a recorded time rather than more vehicles going head to tail in a dangerous street race. One driver at a time accompanied by a co-driver to record the section time will go full throttle at the high speed sections of the available road.
